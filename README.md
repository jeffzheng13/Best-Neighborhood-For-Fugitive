 ### Datasets
 1. The first dataset includes data on the speed humps located in different neighborhoods of Pittsbugh. It includes street names, material type, and id of each hump. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps
 2. The second dataset involves the quantity and description of trees in each neighborhood of Pittsburgh. It includes information such as the type of tree, the height and width of each tree, the location of the trees, and how much space they each have to grow. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees
 3. The third dataset is the Police Incident Blotter (Archive). It contains information about crime incidents that police have responded to in the City of Pittsburgh. The dataset also includes detailed information including detailed hierarchy data, incident location, and the offenses committed. The following data can be accessed from WPDRC: [here.](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data)

### Abstract
Our objective was to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh for a fugitive. Using speed hump data (in case a fugitive needed a quick getaway), police arrest data (to determine the police presence in each neighborhood), and tree data (to use as cover), we have concluded that East Carnegie was the best neighborhood to be a fugitive in. Each member analyzed their own dataset and came up with their own conclusion of the best neighborhoods using metrics deemed appropriate. 
   - For the speed humps, whichever neighborhood had the least would be best. 
   - For police presence, whichever neighborhood had a decreasing and maintained a low presence would be best.
   - For trees, whichever neighborhood had the largest width would be best.
Then the top 3 neighborhoods were ranked and assigned a number, the neighborhood with the lowest sum across all three datasets was declared the best neighborhood.
